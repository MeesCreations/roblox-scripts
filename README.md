## Welcome to roblox-scripts, the place for your Roblox scripts!
![/roblox-scripts banner](https://i.imgur.com/tJGhYR3.png)

## How to use
Once you found a script you want to use in your own game, make sure to follow the instructions given in the script itself. I always put in the scripts where to place it and what script type to use.
Once you've read the instructions, press the raw button which appears in the top bar of the area where the code is shown. After you did that, press `CTRL + A` and `CTRL + C`.
Go to Roblox, open your script and paste the code in that.

It's simple as that! There's no need to give credits (unless told otherwise), but they are always appreciated!

## A script in this repository doesn't work
First of all, make sure it's not you (did you put the script in the correct place? did you change anything you shouldn't change? did you paste the code in the correct script type?).
If you're sure it's not you, add me on Discord via my tag `Mees#2216`. Please include the Output and Script Analysis, and the script as how you've pasted it in Roblox Studio (or just the script as .rbxm/.lua file), in your message to me.

Thanks in advance!

## Thumbnail API endpoints
In some scripts the web APIs of Roblox are used to grab the avatar thumbnail of players. Now, you can customize what type of thumbnail you want to use. These are the thumbnails you can use and how to change them to it. Sizes are also included, but they are not that relevant if you just change my scripts and do nothing else with them than where they were made for.

Full avatar - `https://www.roblox.com/Thumbs/Avatar.ashx?userid=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

Bust - `https://www.roblox.com/bust-thumbnail/image?userId=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

Headshot - `https://www.roblox.com/headshot-thumbnail/image?userId=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

Replace the USERID part with the user ID. In the scripts of me, we will put the `..plr.UserId..` code on that place (might be `..player.UserId..` as well).
Replace the SIZE part with the size you want to use. These are the sizes you can use:
- 48x48
- 50x50
- 60x60
- 75x75
- 100x100
- 110x110
- 150x150
- 180x180
- 250x250
- 352x352 (recommended for Discord webhook)
- 420x420
- 720x720

In case you need more help with this, contact me though Discord (`Mees#2216)`.

## Who are you?
My name is Mees, better known as DutchBloxxer, and I'm a person from The Netherlands. I'm on Roblox as player since 2012, and I started developing in 2014 (but I wasn't that experienced and good back in the days).

I'm a solo developer and I love to program in Lua. I also make games on Roblox under my development studio: [Mees' Creations](https://www.roblox.com/groups/8806074)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Do I have to credit you when using scripts in this repository?**<br>
No, it's not mandatory. However, I would strongly appreciate it if you can add a reference to this repository so even more people can use the scripts in here.<br>
However, please do **not** re-upload scripts in here and claim them as your own. I don't want to put a license on this repository (because it would require people to credit me), but if this happens more often, I will have to.

**Are the scripts in this repository compatible with FilteringEnabled?**<br>
Yes, all scripts are compatible with FilteringEnabled.

**Will scripts in this repository receive updates?**<br>
Scripts in here do not receive mandatory updates. Everything in this repository is tested intensively and working as it should. However, sometimes I do release updates to scripts for the following reasons:
* Bug fixes (in case Roblox released an update which broke (parts of) the script
* Code optimization
* Changes to instructions and notes in scripts (these don't affect the working of the script)

As mentioned above, **all** scripts here are tested and working. You don't have to stress about updating your scripts once in a while.
In case this repository will ever get scripts that will get updates often, I'll use a loader so you don't have to worry about updating.

**A script in this repository stopped working**<br>
This has been answered earlier in this README file. Please scroll up to "A script in this repository doesn't work".

**I need a script which isn't in this repository**<br>
If it's a script everyone could use, please contact me via Discord (`Mees#2216`) so I can see what I can do. Please keep in mind that I don't make scripts for private use for free (all scripts I make on request must fit in this repository so others can also use it).

**Do scripts in this repository contain backdoors?**<br>
No. You can check this yourself. There currently are no scripts which contain loaders, which are used for backdoors. There also is no obfuscated code where these could be hidden.
I hate backdoors as much as you do, and that's why I created this repository; to make a safe and accessible place for your scripts.

**Do you create exploiting scripts?**<br>
I'm not helping you with ruining other's playing experiences, sorry.

## Anything else which isn't answered here
Feel free to add me on Discord (`Mees#2216`), I don't care if it's just to say hi or to ask a complicated question. I'm always in for a conversation!
