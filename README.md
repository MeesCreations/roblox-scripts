## Welcome to roblox-scripts, the place for your Roblox scripts!
![/roblox-scripts banner](Repo-Assets/roblox-scripts.png)

## How to use
Once you found a script you want to use in your own game, make sure to follow the instructions given in the script itself. I always put in the scripts where to place it and what script type to use.
Once you've read the instructions, press the raw button which appears in the top bar of the area where the code is showed. After you did that, press `CTRL + A` and `CTRL + C`.
Go to Roblox, open your script and paste the code in that.

It's simple as that! There's no need to give credits (unless told otherwise), but they are always appreciated!

## A script in this repository doesn't work
First of all, make sure it's not you (did you put the script in the correct place? did you change anything you shouldn't change? did you paste the code in the correct script type?).
If you're pretty sure it's not you, add me on Discord via my tag `Mees#2216`. Please include the Output and Script Analysis, and the script as how you've pasted it in Roblox Studio (or just the script as .rbxm/.lua file).

Thanks in advance!

## Thumbnail API endpoints
In some scripts the web APIs of Roblox are used to grab the avatar thumbnail of players. Now, you can customize what type of thumbnail you want to use. These are the thumbnails you can use and how to change them to it. Sizes are also included, but they are not that relevant if you just change my scripts and do nothing else with them than where they were made for.

Full avatar - `https://www.roblox.com/Thumbs/Avatar.ashx?userid=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

![Example: full avatar](Repo-Assets/FullAvatar.png)

Bust - `https://www.roblox.com/bust-thumbnail/image?userId=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

Headshot - `https://www.roblox.com/headshot-thumbnail/image?userId=USERID&width=SIZE&height=SIZE`

![Example: headshot](Repo-Assets/AvatarHeadshot.png)

Replace the USERID part with the user ID. In the scripts of me, we will put the `..plr.UserId..` code on that place (might be `..player.UserId..` as well).
Replace the SIZE part with the size you want to use. These are the sizes you can use:
- 48x48
- 50x50
- 60x60
- 75x75
- 100x100
- 110x110
- 150x150
- 180x180
- 250x250
- 352x352 (recommended for Discord webhook)
- 420x420
- 720x720

In case you need more help with this, contact me though Discord (`Mees#2216)`.

## Who are you?

I'm a solo developer and I love to program in Lua. I also make games on Roblox under my development studio: [Mees' Creations](https://www.roblox.com/groups/8806074)

## Anything else which isn't answered here
Feel free to add me on Discord (`Mees#2216`), I don't care if it's just to say hi or to ask a complicated question. I'm always in for a conversation!
