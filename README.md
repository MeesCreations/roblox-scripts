## Welcome to roblox-scripts, the place for your Roblox scripts!
Thanks for visiting this GitHub repository where I publish my scripts.

Some of you might remember that I used to publish my open-sourced scripts on the Roblox library instead of on GitHub, but I've decided to stop doing this for scripts that aren't that simple to prevent stupid idiots from stealing these scripts and claiming them as their own.
Of course, they can still do that now, but I hope that I can lower the chances by publishing them here instead because GitHub is focused on developers, and since people who steal stuff to claim it as their own aren't true developers in my opinion. I also moved my stuff here so I can add licenses to scripts I don't want to be copied or used without being credited.

Anyways, let's get straight into the information.

## How to use
Once you found a script you want to use in your own game, make sure to follow the instructions given in the script itself. I always put in the scripts where to place it and what script type to use.
Once you've read the instructions, press the raw button which appears in the top bar of the area where the code is showed. After you did that, press `CTRL + A` and `CTRL + C`.
Go to Roblox, open your script and paste the code in that.

It's simple as that! There's no need to give credits (unless told otherwise), but they are always appreciated!

## A script in this repository doesn't work
First of all, make sure it's not you (did you put the script in the correct place? did you change anything you shouldn't change? did you paste the code in the correct script type?).
If you're pretty sure it's not you, add me on Discord via my tag `Mees#2216`. Please include the Output and Script Analysis, and the script as how you've pasted it in Roblox (or just the script as .rbxm/.lua) file.

## Anything else which isn't answered here
Feel free to add me on Discord (`Mees#2216`), I don't care if it's just to say hi or to ask a complicated question. I'm always into a conversation (but I might not always have time to respond immediately).
