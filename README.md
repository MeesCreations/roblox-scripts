## Who are you and why did you create this repository?
My name is Mees, better known as DutchBloxxer, and I'm a solo developer from The Netherlands. I'm on Roblox since 2012, and I started creating games in 2014.

[![Roblox avatar headshot](https://www.roblox.com/headshot-thumbnail/image?userId=33491692&width=250&height=250&format=png)](https://www.roblox.com/users/33491692/profile)

Scripting is my favorite thing to do on Roblox and nearly all scripts in my games are wrote by me.
Scripting takes time and effort, and I love to take this time for it. Some people who create games on Roblox might not, so that's why I share some of my scripts in this repository.

## How to use
Once you found a script you want to use in your own game, make sure to follow the instructions given in the script itself. I always put in the scripts where to place it and what script type to use.
Once you've read the instructions, press the raw button which appears in the top bar of the area where the code is shown. After you did that, press `CTRL + A` and `CTRL + C`.
Go to Roblox, open your script and paste the code in that.

It's simple as that! There's no need to give credits (unless told otherwise), but feel free to leave a reference to my [Roblox profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/33491692/profile) and/or this repository.

## Troubleshooting
Please answer these questions for yourself to make sure it's not just you:

 - Did you follow all instructions given inside of the script and/or the README file in the folder where you found it?
 - Did you paste the script in the place where it should belong?
 - Did you create the correct type script? (Script/LocalScript/ModuleScript)
 - Did you only change the lines you should have changed?

If you can answer these questions with a no, follow the steps below:

1. Open the Output and Script Analysis
 2. Start your game in Play Solo mode
 3. Take a screenshot of the Output and Script Analysis
 4. Save the script as .lua file
 5. Add me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/227006557207003138) (`Mees#2216`)
 6. Attach the screenshot and .lua file to your message and send it

Thanks for your reporting! I will fix the script as fast as possible after I received your message.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Do I have to credit you when using scripts in this repository?**<br>
A link to my profile and/or this repository is always very appreciated. Feel free do so, but it's not mandatory.

**Are the scripts in this repository compatible with FilteringEnabled?**<br>
Yes, all scripts are compatible with FilteringEnabled.

**Will scripts in this repository receive updates?**<br>
Scripts in here do not receive mandatory updates. Everything in this repository is tested and working as it should. However, sometimes I do release updates to scripts for the following reasons:
* Bug fixes (in the rare case a script wasn't working properly or if a Roblox update broke it)
* Code optimization
* Changes to instructions and notes in scripts (these don't affect the working of the script)

As mentioned above, **all** scripts here are tested and working. You don't have to stress about updating your scripts once in a while.

**A script in this repository stopped working**<br>
Please follow the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) steps above in this file.

**I need a script which isn't in this repository**<br>
If it's a script everyone could use, please contact me via Discord (`Mees#2216`) so I can see what I can do. Please keep in mind that I don't make scripts for private use for free (all scripts I make on request must fit in this repository so others can also use them).

**Do scripts in this repository contain backdoors?**<br>
No. You can check this yourself. There currently are no scripts which contain loaders, which are used for backdoors. There also is no obfuscated code where these could be hidden.

**Where can I find thumbnail API endpoints I can use?**<br>
These can be found [here](https://github.com/MeesJ/roblox-scripts/blob/scripts/ThumbnailAPI.md).

**Do you create exploiting scripts?**<br>
I'm not helping you with ruining other's playing experiences, sorry.<br>
*I might create exploiting scripts for educational purposes (helping developers to improve their anti-exploit systems) someday, but I will never create those to help people ruining the gameplay of other's.*

**What's the difference between [General scripts](https://github.com/MeesJ/roblox-scripts/tree/scripts/General%20scripts) and the other directories?**<br>
[General scripts](https://github.com/MeesJ/roblox-scripts/tree/scripts/General%20scripts) is a directory containing scripts that are individual and don't have other variants of them.
